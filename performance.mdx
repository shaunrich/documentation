# Performance Issues and Mitigation Strategies

## 1. Image Optimization

**Issue:** The app is using Next.js Image component with `unoptimized: true` (as per user memory), which disables Next.js built-in image optimization.

**Mitigation:**
- Consider enabling Next.js image optimization for specific domains using `remotePatterns` in next.config.ts instead of completely disabling optimization
- Implement responsive images with appropriate sizes for different viewport widths
- Use modern image formats like WebP or AVIF where supported

## 2. Firebase Data Fetching

**Issue:** All products are fetched at once on the main page load without pagination or lazy loading.

**Mitigation:**
- Implement pagination or infinite scrolling to load products in smaller batches
- Add caching mechanisms for product data
- Consider using Firebase query limits and ordering to fetch only what's needed
- Implement server-side rendering (SSR) for initial product data to improve First Contentful Paint

## 3. Animation Performance

**Issue:** Heavy use of Framer Motion animations, especially in ProductCard and SwipeContainer components, may cause performance issues on lower-end devices.

**Mitigation:**
- Reduce animation complexity for mobile devices
- Use the `useReducedMotion` hook from Framer Motion to respect user preferences
- Implement progressive enhancement for animations
- Consider using CSS animations for simpler effects

## 4. Render Optimization

**Issue:** The SwipeContainer component re-renders frequently due to state changes and animation effects.

**Mitigation:**
- Implement React.memo for ProductCard components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Use useCallback for event handlers to maintain referential equality
- Consider using virtualization for long lists of products
- Split complex components into smaller, more focused components

## 5. Analytics Overhead

**Issue:** Multiple analytics tracking calls are made during user interactions, which can impact performance.

**Mitigation:**
- Batch analytics events where possible
- Defer non-critical tracking events
- Consider using a queue system for analytics events
- Implement a throttling mechanism for high-frequency events (like swipes)

## 6. Session Storage Usage

**Issue:** The app uses sessionStorage to track viewed products, which can lead to performance issues with a large number of products.

**Mitigation:**
- Use more efficient storage methods for tracking viewed products
- Implement a cleanup mechanism to remove old entries
- Consider using a more structured approach like IndexedDB for client-side storage

## 7. CSS and JavaScript Bundle Size

**Issue:** No visible code splitting or lazy loading of components.

**Mitigation:**
- Implement code splitting using dynamic imports
- Lazy load non-critical components
- Optimize Tailwind CSS usage by purging unused styles
- Consider implementing module/component level code splitting

## 8. Firebase Configuration Logging

**Issue:** Firebase configuration is being logged to the console, which is unnecessary in production.

**Mitigation:**
- Remove or conditionally log Firebase configuration based on environment
- Implement proper environment-based logging

## 9. Memory Management

**Issue:** The app keeps all products in memory even after they've been processed.

**Mitigation:**
- Implement a more efficient data structure for tracking processed products
- Clean up resources when components unmount
- Consider using a more memory-efficient approach for managing product state
