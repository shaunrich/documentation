# User Management Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive guide to user management in the SVYP platform. It covers both end-user management and administrative user management, explaining the different user types, authentication methods, and management workflows.

## User Types

The SVYP platform supports two main categories of users:

1. **End Users**
   - Regular users who interact with the platform to view products, campaigns, and brands
   - Can browse content without authentication
   - Interactions (likes, dislikes) are tracked anonymously or with optional authentication

2. **Admin Users**
   - Manage the platform's content and settings
   - Require authentication to access admin features
   - Have role-based permissions (see [Admin User Roles](./admin-user-roles.md) for details)

## Authentication Methods

### End User Authentication

End users can interact with the platform in two ways:

1. **Anonymous Browsing**
   - No authentication required
   - Limited tracking via browser cookies
   - Basic analytics data collected

2. **Optional Authentication**
   - Users can create accounts for enhanced features
   - Authentication handled through Firebase Authentication
   - Supports email/password and social login options

### Admin Authentication

Admin users must authenticate to access the admin dashboard:

1. **Email/Password Authentication**
   - Primary authentication method for admin users
   - Credentials stored securely in Firebase Authentication
   - Session-based authentication with secure cookies

2. **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Optional additional security layer
   - Can be enabled per admin user
   - Supports SMS and authenticator app verification

## User Data Structure

### End User Data

```typescript
interface EndUser {
  uid: string;         // Unique identifier
  email?: string;      // Optional email address
  displayName?: string;// Optional display name
  createdAt: number;   // Timestamp of account creation
  lastLoginAt?: number;// Timestamp of last login
  preferences?: {      // User preferences
    notifications: boolean;
    theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'system';
  };
}
```

### Admin User Data

```typescript
interface AdminUser {
  uid: string;         // Unique identifier
  email: string;       // Email address (required)
  displayName?: string;// Optional display name
  createdAt?: number;  // Timestamp of account creation
  lastLoginAt?: number;// Timestamp of last login
  disabled?: boolean;  // Whether the account is disabled
  role?: 'super-admin' | 'admin'; // User role
}
```

## User Management Workflows

### End User Management

1. **User Registration**
   - Users can register through the platform's sign-up form
   - Required fields: email, password
   - Optional fields: display name
   - Verification email sent upon registration

2. **User Profile Management**
   - Users can update their profile information
   - Change password functionality
   - Update notification preferences
   - Delete account option

3. **User Activity Tracking**
   - Product interactions (views, likes, dislikes)
   - Campaign engagement metrics
   - Brand affinity tracking

### Admin User Management

Detailed information about admin user management can be found in the [Admin User Roles](./admin-user-roles.md) documentation. Key workflows include:

1. **Admin User Creation**
   - Super-admins can create new admin users
   - Initial setup requires the `setup-admin.ts` script

2. **Role Assignment and Management**
   - Super-admins can assign and modify roles
   - Role changes take effect immediately

3. **Account Security**
   - Password reset functionality
   - Account disabling/enabling
   - Session management and timeout settings

## Implementation Details

### Firebase Integration

User management is implemented using Firebase Authentication and custom claims:

1. **Authentication**
   - Firebase Authentication handles credential storage and verification
   - Secure password hashing and storage
   - Token-based authentication with short-lived JWTs

2. **Custom Claims**
   - Admin roles stored as custom claims
   - Claims verified on both client and server
   - Used for role-based access control

3. **Security Rules**
   - Firestore security rules enforce access control
   - Different read/write permissions based on user type and role

For more details on Firebase integration, see the [Firebase Integration](./firebase-integration.md) documentation.

### API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available for user management:

1. **End User Endpoints**
   - `/api/auth/register` - Register a new user
   - `/api/auth/login` - Authenticate a user
   - `/api/auth/logout` - End a user session
   - `/api/users/profile` - Get or update user profile

2. **Admin User Endpoints**
   - `/api/users` - List all users (admin only)
   - `/api/users` - Create a new admin user (super-admin only)
   - `/api/users/[uid]` - Get, update, or delete a specific user
   - `/api/users/[uid]/role` - Update a user's role (super-admin only)

## Best Practices

1. **Security**
   - Always verify user permissions on the server side
   - Use HTTPS for all API requests
   - Implement proper CSRF protection
   - Set secure and HTTP-only flags on cookies

2. **Performance**
   - Cache user data where appropriate
   - Minimize token size by limiting custom claims
   - Use server-side pagination for user lists

3. **Privacy**
   - Only collect necessary user information
   - Provide clear privacy policy
   - Implement data deletion workflows
   - Comply with relevant privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failures**
   - Check for correct email/password
   - Verify account is not disabled
   - Check for browser cookie settings blocking authentication

2. **Permission Errors**
   - Verify user has the correct role assigned
   - Check that custom claims are properly set
   - Ensure token is not expired

3. **Session Issues**
   - Clear browser cookies and cache
   - Try logging out and back in
   - Check for clock skew between client and server
