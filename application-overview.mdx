## üè¢ Organisational Structure and Data Model

The foundation of SVYP rests on its three-tier hierarchical data model, with brands at the top level, campaigns in the middle, and products at the bottom. Each brand serves as a container for multiple campaigns, allowing businesses to maintain consistent branding across various marketing initiatives. Campaigns within SVYP represent specific marketing efforts, each containing a curated selection of products tailored to particular audiences or themes. Products, the most granular element in the hierarchy, can be associated with specific brands and can appear in multiple campaigns, providing flexibility in how items are showcased across the platform. This structured approach enables businesses to organise their offerings in a logical manner that mirrors real-world marketing strategies.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Infrastructure

</Frame>

SVYP leverages a modern technical stack centred around Next.js 15.2.3 and React 18.2.0, providing a solid foundation for building a responsive, interactive web application. The platform's data management relies on Firebase and Firestore, offering real-time data synchronisation and secure authentication services. For styling, SVYP employs Tailwind CSS 4, enabling rapid development of responsive interfaces with consistent design patterns. The application enhances user experience through Framer Motion for smooth animations and transitions, while Swiper provides touch-enabled carousel functionality for product browsing. Data visualisation components from Tremor offer administrators valuable insights through charts and graphs, complemented by analytics tracking via Mixpanel.

## üîí Security and Authentication

Security is a paramount concern for SVYP, implemented through Firebase Authentication to manage user identity and access. The platform employs session-based authentication with secure cookies, protected by server-side middleware that validates user sessions before granting access to restricted areas. Admin routes are especially secured, with all administrative functions requiring proper authentication and role validation. The role-based access control system distinguishes between super-admin and admin users, with each role having carefully defined permissions appropriate to their responsibilities. Super-admins possess comprehensive control over the platform, including the ability to manage other administrators, while regular admins have sufficient privileges to handle day-to-day content management tasks without the potential to modify system-critical settings.

## üë• User Experience and Interface

The user interface of SVYP is designed with a focus on intuitive navigation and visual appeal, guiding visitors through brands and campaigns with clear hierarchical signposting. Brand pages showcase logos and associated campaigns, while campaign pages display curated collections of products with detailed information and visuals. The responsive design ensures consistent functionality across devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones, adapting layouts and interactions appropriately for each screen size. Interactive elements like product carousels use the Swiper library to provide smooth, touch-friendly browsing experiences on mobile devices. The design system maintains consistent branding throughout the application, with careful attention to typography, colour schemes, and spacing to create a polished, professional appearance.

## üß© Key Features for End Users

For end users, SVYP offers a seamless browsing experience through brands and their associated campaigns, with intuitive navigation that reflects the hierarchical relationship between these entities. The platform's URL structure mirrors this hierarchy, with paths like `/{brandSlug}/{campaignSlug}` providing logical and shareable links to specific content. Product displays include comprehensive information such as names, descriptions, prices, and high-quality images, all presented in an aesthetically pleasing layout. The swipe functionality, powered by the Swiper library, enables users to browse through products with natural touch gestures on mobile devices or mouse interactions on desktops. User engagement is enhanced through features like a rewards system that encourages interaction and return visits to the platform.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Administrative Capabilities

Administrators of SVYP access a powerful dashboard through the `/admin` route, where they can manage all aspects of the platform's content and settings. The admin interface provides comprehensive tools for creating, editing, and organising brands, campaigns, and products, with intuitive forms and validations to ensure data integrity. User management capabilities allow super-admins to control access to the system by creating and configuring admin accounts with appropriate permission levels. Analytics integration offers valuable insights into user behaviour, campaign performance, and engagement metrics, helping administrators make data-driven decisions about content strategy. Content management includes robust tools for uploading and managing images through Vercel Blob storage, ensuring high-quality visual assets throughout the platform.

## üìä Data Integration and Sources

SVYP's primary data source is Firebase Firestore, which stores all information about brands, campaigns, products, and users in a flexible, document-based structure. The application integrates with Firebase Authentication to manage user identity and access control, maintaining secure sessions through HTTP-only cookies. Vercel Blob provides cloud storage for images and other media assets, offering reliable and scalable content delivery. Analytics data is captured and processed through Mixpanel integration, tracking user interactions and campaign performance metrics. Email notifications are handled through integration with Postmark, enabling automated communication for administrative alerts and user engagement.

## üöÄ Deployment and Infrastructure

The application is designed for deployment on Vercel's hosting platform, taking advantage of its seamless integration with Next.js applications and global content delivery network. CI/CD pipelines are implemented through GitHub Actions, automating the testing and deployment process whenever changes are pushed to the repository. Environment variables manage configuration across different deployment environments, ensuring secure handling of sensitive information like API keys and service credentials. Infrastructure is managed as code through Vercel's configuration files, enabling consistent deployment across staging and production environments. The deployment process includes automated checks for code quality, type safety, and testing to maintain high standards in the production environment.

## üéØ Business Value and Outcomes

SVYP delivers significant business value by providing a centralised platform for marketing campaigns that maintains brand consistency while showcasing products effectively. The hierarchical organisation of brands, campaigns, and products mirrors real-world marketing structures, making the platform intuitive for marketing teams to adopt and use. Analytics integration offers valuable insights into campaign performance, helping businesses understand which products and approaches resonate most strongly with their audience. The role-based access control system enables organisations to delegate management responsibilities appropriately while maintaining oversight of the platform's content and direction. By streamlining the process of creating and managing marketing campaigns, SVYP helps businesses bring their products to market more efficiently and effectively.

## üíª Development and Maintenance

The development workflow for SVYP emphasises code quality and consistency through automated tools like ESLint and Prettier, enforced via Husky pre-commit hooks. TypeScript provides strong typing throughout the codebase, reducing runtime errors and improving developer productivity through better tooling support. Component-based architecture using React functional components and hooks promotes reusability and separation of concerns, making the codebase more maintainable as it grows. Documentation is integrated directly into the development process, with comprehensive markdown files explaining key concepts, workflows, and architectural decisions.

SVYP places significant emphasis on providing an optimal experience across all devices, with responsive designs that adapt to various screen sizes and orientations. Mobile users benefit from touch-optimised interfaces, with swipe gestures for navigating through product collections and appropriately sized touch targets for buttons and links. The application uses Tailwind CSS's responsive utility classes to implement different layouts at various breakpoints, ensuring content remains readable and accessible regardless of device. Performance optimisations like image lazy-loading and component code-splitting help maintain fast load times even on mobile networks. The swipe speed limiter functionality ensures that touch interactions feel natural and controlled, preventing accidental rapid swiping through product collections.

## üîç Search and Discovery

Although not the primary focus, SVYP includes basic search and discovery functionality to help users find relevant content within the platform. The hierarchical organisation of brands and campaigns provides natural entry points for browsing, with clear navigation paths from broad categories to specific products. Campaign pages showcase curated collections of products, offering a focused browsing experience around specific themes or promotions. The URL structure of the application supports direct access to specific brands or campaigns, making it easy to share links to particular content through other marketing channels. Future enhancements could include more advanced search capabilities, filtering options, and personalised recommendations based on user behaviour and preferences.

## üìà Analytics and Insights

SVYP integrates with Mixpanel to provide comprehensive analytics on user behaviour, campaign performance, and engagement metrics. The analytics implementation tracks key events such as page views, product interactions, and conversion actions, building a detailed picture of how users engage with the platform. Administrators can access these insights through visual dashboards that highlight trends, patterns, and areas for improvement in their marketing campaigns. The data collected through analytics helps businesses understand which products attract the most interest and which campaigns drive the strongest engagement, informing future marketing strategies. Privacy considerations are built into the analytics implementation, with appropriate consent mechanisms and data anonymisation where required by regulations.

## üåê Scalability and Performance
