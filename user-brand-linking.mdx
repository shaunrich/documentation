# User-Brand Linking Documentation

## Overview

The SVYP platform implements a comprehensive user-brand linking system that controls access to brand-related resources throughout the application. This document explains how brands are linked to users, how these links are managed, and how they affect the user interface in the admin section.

## User Roles and Brand Access

The platform has three primary user types with different levels of brand access:

1. **Super Admin (`super-admin`)**: 
   - Can view and manage all brands in the system
   - Can create, edit, and delete any brand
   - Can link/unlink brands to any user
   - Has full visibility across all brand-related data

2. **Admin (`admin`)**: 
   - Can view and manage all brands in the system
   - Can create, edit, and delete any brand
   - Cannot manage user roles or link/unlink brands to users (reserved for super-admins)

3. **Regular User (no specific role)**: 
   - Can only view and manage brands they are linked to
   - When creating a new brand, automatically becomes linked to that brand
   - Cannot see or manage brands they are not linked to

## Technical Implementation

### User-Brand Linking Mechanism

User-brand links are stored as custom claims in Firebase Authentication:

- Each user has a `brandIds` array in their custom claims containing IDs of linked brands
- This array is managed through the Firebase Admin SDK
- The links are retrieved during authentication and stored in the AuthContext

### API Endpoints

1. **`/api/users/[uid]/route.ts`**: 
   - PATCH endpoint with `updateBrands` action (super-admin only)
   - Used to update brand links for any user

2. **`/api/users/brands/route.ts`**: 
   - POST endpoint to link a brand to the current user
   - Used when a non-admin user creates a new brand
   - Automatically links the newly created brand to the user

3. **`/api/auth/me/route.ts`**: 
   - GET endpoint to retrieve current user information
   - Returns `brandIds` array containing IDs of linked brands

### Automatic Brand Linking

When a non-admin user creates a new brand:

1. The brand is created in the database
2. The system automatically calls the `/api/users/brands` endpoint
3. The new brand ID is added to the user's `brandIds` array
4. The user's role is refreshed to update the UI with the new brand link

## Impact on Admin UI

### Brands Admin Page

- **For Super Admins and Admins**: 
  - Displays all brands in the system
  - No filtering is applied based on user links

- **For Regular Users**: 
  - Only displays brands linked to the user
  - Filtered based on the `brandIds` array in the user's claims
  - Newly created brands appear immediately after creation

### Products Admin Page

- Includes a "Filter by brand" component
- For regular users, this filter only shows brands linked to the user
- For admins and super-admins, it shows all brands

### Campaigns Admin Page

- Similar to the Products page, includes a "Filter by brand" component
- Filtering respects the user's brand links and role

## User Experience Flow

### Regular User Flow

1. User logs in and accesses the Brands admin page
2. Only sees brands they are linked to
3. Creates a new brand
4. System automatically links the brand to the user
5. The new brand appears in their brand list
6. User can now manage this brand and its associated products/campaigns

### Admin User Flow

1. Admin logs in and accesses the Brands admin page
2. Sees all brands in the system
3. Can manage any brand regardless of links
4. When creating a new brand, no automatic linking is needed

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Brand and Campaign Hierarchy

The user-brand linking system integrates with the existing brand-campaign hierarchy:

- Brands serve as the top-level organizational unit
- Campaigns are associated with brands via `brandId`
- Products can be associated with both brands and campaigns

This hierarchical structure is reflected in the URL routing: `/${brand.slug}/${campaign.slug}`

### Role-Based Access Control

The user-brand linking system extends the existing role-based access control system:

- Super-admin and admin roles have system-wide permissions
- Regular users have permissions scoped to their linked brands
- Authentication is required for all admin operations

## Best Practices

1. **Super Admin Management**: 
   - Super admins should regularly audit user-brand links
   - Use the User Management page to adjust brand links as needed

2. **Brand Creation**: 
   - When creating brands for specific users, consider who should have access
   - For brands that should be private to specific users, ensure proper linking

3. **Performance Considerations**: 
   - Brand filtering is done client-side for better performance
   - The system uses memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **User cannot see a brand**: 
   - Check if the user is linked to the brand
   - Verify the user's role in the User Management page
   - Try refreshing the user's session

2. **Brand not automatically linked**: 
   - Check browser console for API errors
   - Verify the user doesn't have admin or super-admin role
   - Check network requests to `/api/users/brands` endpoint

3. **Brand filtering not working**: 
   - Ensure the AuthContext is properly loaded
   - Check if `brandIds` is correctly populated
   - Verify the filtering logic in the component
