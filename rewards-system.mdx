# SVYP Rewards System

## Overview

The SVYP rewards system allows brands to offer incentives to users who complete a card stack voting session. When users finish swiping through all product cards, they're presented with an opportunity to claim a reward by providing their email address. The system then randomly selects an available reward from the brand's reward pool and sends it to the user via email.

## Reward Structure

Each reward in the system has the following properties:

- **Associated Brand**: Links the reward to a specific brand
- **Reward Name**: The title of the reward (e.g., "10% Discount")
- **Reward Description**: Detailed information about the reward
- **Reward Code**: Unique code that users can redeem (e.g., "SUMMER10")
- **Max Number of Uses**: Controls how many times a reward can be awarded
  - A value of 0 means unlimited uses
- **Number of Uses**: Tracks how many times the reward has been awarded

## Admin Management

Administrators can manage rewards through the admin interface at `/admin/rewards`. The interface provides the following capabilities:

1. **Creating Rewards**:

   - Assign to a specific brand
   - Set a name and description
   - Enter a reward code
   - Set usage limits (0 for unlimited)

2. **Editing Rewards**:

   - Modify any reward properties
   - Update usage limits
   - Change reward codes

3. **Deleting Rewards**:

   - Remove rewards that are no longer needed

4. **Filtering and Viewing**:
   - Filter rewards by brand
   - See which rewards are available vs. depleted
   - Track usage statistics

## User Flow

1. **Card Stack Completion**:

   - User swipes through all product cards in a campaign
   - Upon completion, the reward card appears

2. **Email Collection**:

   - User is prompted to enter their email address
   - System validates the email format
   - User sees a loading spinner while their reward is being processed

3. **Reward Selection**:

   - System checks if the brand has available rewards
   - If available, a random reward is selected from the pool
   - The reward's usage count is incremented

4. **Email Delivery**:

   - Selected reward is sent to the user's email
   - Email includes the reward name, description, and code
   - Branded with the campaign/brand information
   - Includes personalized product recommendations based on user likes (up to 3 products)
   - Product recommendations feature direct affiliate links with "Shop Now" buttons
   - User sees a loading indicator while the email is being sent

5. **Confirmation**:
   - User sees a confirmation message that the reward has been sent
   - Option to view a summary of their product preferences

## Handling No Available Rewards

When all rewards for a brand have reached their maximum usage limit:

1. The system detects this condition when the user loads the card stack
2. After completing the stack, users see a message explaining that all rewards have been claimed
3. Their email can still be collected for marketing purposes or future rewards

## Technical Implementation

The rewards system consists of several components:

1. **Data Storage**:

   - Rewards are stored in the Firebase Firestore `rewards` collection
   - Each reward document contains all necessary fields and metadata

2. **API Endpoint**:

   - `/api/rewards/send-email` handles reward selection and email sending
   - Validates inputs, selects a random reward, and updates usage counts
   - Uses Postmark for reliable email delivery
   - Processes user-liked products for personalized recommendations
   - Supports affiliate link integration for product recommendations

3. **Client Components**:

   - `RewardCard.tsx` displays the reward UI, email collection form, and loading states
   - `SwipeContainer.tsx` manages the overall card stack, reward flow, loading states, and tracks user preferences
   - User product likes are captured and passed to the reward email system
   - Loading states provide visual feedback during asynchronous operations

4. **Utility Functions**:
   - `rewards.ts` provides helper functions for reward operations
   - `firebase.ts` includes database operations for rewards
   - `emailTemplates.ts` contains HTML and text templates for reward emails with personalized product recommendations

## Analytics Integration

The rewards system includes comprehensive Mixpanel tracking to monitor user engagement and reward effectiveness:

1. **Tracked Events**:

   - `Reward Shown`: When a user reaches the end of the card stack and sees the reward card
   - `Reward Claimed`: When a user submits their email to claim a reward
   - `Reward Sent`: When a reward is successfully sent to the user's email
   - `No Rewards Available`: When a user attempts to claim a reward but none are available

2. **Event Properties**:

   - Reward details (ID, name, code)
   - Campaign information (ID, name, slug)
   - Brand information (ID, name, slug)
   - User email
   - Timestamp

3. **Analytics Benefits**:

   - Track reward claim rates
   - Monitor which rewards are most popular
   - Identify campaigns with high reward engagement
   - Detect when reward pools are depleted
   - Measure the effectiveness of different reward types

4. **Implementation**:
   - Analytics functions are defined in `utils/analytics.ts`
   - Tracking is integrated at key points in the reward flow
   - Events follow a consistent naming convention for easy querying

## Email Delivery with Postmark

The system uses Postmark for reliable email delivery of rewards:

1. **Configuration**:

   - Requires `POSTMARK_API_TOKEN` and `POSTMARK_FROM_EMAIL` environment variables
   - Uses the Postmark Node.js client library

2. **Email Templates**:

   - HTML template with responsive design
   - Plain text fallback for email clients that don't support HTML
   - Includes reward details, branding, and redemption code
   - Features a "Products You Might Like" section with up to 3 products the user has liked
   - Each product includes a "Shop Now" button linking to its affiliate URL
   - Limited to 3 products for optimal email layout and loading performance

3. **Implementation**:

   - Email sending logic is in the `/api/rewards/send-email` route
   - Templates are extracted to `utils/emailTemplates.ts` for maintainability
   - Includes error handling and logging with Postmark's MessageID

4. **Benefits**:
   - High deliverability rates
   - Email analytics and tracking
   - Reliable service with delivery guarantees
   - Professional email templates

## Security Considerations

- Only authenticated admins can create, edit, or delete rewards
- Brand-specific admins can only see, filter, and manage rewards for their assigned brands
- When creating rewards, brand-specific admins can only select from their associated brands
- Super admins have access to all rewards across all brands

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to the rewards system could include:

1. **Waitlist System**: When no rewards are available, add users to a waitlist for future rewards
2. **Scheduled Rewards**: Set start and end dates for reward availability
3. **Reward Categories**: Group rewards by type or value
4. **Enhanced Analytics**: Track affiliate link click-through and conversion rates
5. **User Profiles**: Allow users to view their claimed rewards in a profile section
6. **A/B Testing**: Test different email layouts and product recommendation strategies
7. **Recommendation Algorithm**: Implement more sophisticated product recommendation logic beyond user likes
8. **Enhanced Loading States**: Add more detailed progress indicators showing each step of the reward process
9. **Offline Support**: Allow users to claim rewards even with intermittent connectivity
