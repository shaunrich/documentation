# Linting and Formatting Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the linting and formatting standards used in the SVYP project. Following these standards ensures code consistency and quality across the codebase.

## Tools

The SVYP project uses the following tools for code quality:

1. **ESLint**: For static code analysis and enforcing coding standards
2. **Prettier**: For consistent code formatting
3. **TypeScript**: For type checking
4. **Husky & lint-staged**: For pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality

## ESLint Configuration

ESLint is configured to enforce best practices for React and TypeScript development. The configuration is defined in `.eslintrc.json`.

Key rules include:

- React hooks rules
- TypeScript-specific rules
- Accessibility (a11y) rules
- Import ordering
- Unused variables detection

## Prettier Configuration

Prettier ensures consistent code formatting across the project. The configuration is defined in `.prettierrc`.

Key settings include:

- Single quotes for strings
- No semicolons
- 2-space indentation
- 100 character line length
- Trailing commas in multi-line objects and arrays

## VS Code Integration

For VS Code users, we recommend installing the ESLint and Prettier extensions. The project includes a `.vscode/settings.json` file that configures:

- Format on save
- Default formatter (Prettier)
- ESLint validation

## Running Linting and Formatting

### Manual Commands

You can run these commands manually:

```bash
# Run ESLint
npm run lint

# Fix ESLint issues automatically where possible
npm run lint:fix

# Format code with Prettier
npm run format
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses Husky and lint-staged to run linting and formatting checks before each commit:

1. ESLint checks for code quality issues
2. Prettier formats the code
3. TypeScript checks for type errors

If any of these checks fail, the commit will be blocked until the issues are resolved.

## Common Issues and Solutions

### ESLint Errors

- **Unused variables**: Remove or use the variable
- **Missing dependencies in useEffect**: Add all dependencies to the dependency array
- **Accessibility issues**: Ensure proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML

### Prettier Conflicts

If you encounter conflicts between ESLint and Prettier:

1. Make sure both extensions are installed in VS Code
2. Check that the ESLint config extends Prettier
3. Try running `npm run lint:fix` followed by `npm run format`

## Adding New Rules

When adding new ESLint rules or Prettier configurations:

1. Discuss with the team first
2. Update the relevant configuration file
3. Run linting and formatting on the entire codebase
4. Document the change in this guide

## Best Practices

1. **Run linting locally** before pushing changes
2. **Fix issues as they arise** rather than accumulating them
3. **Use TypeScript properly** to leverage its type safety benefits
4. **Comment code** when complex logic needs explanation
5. **Keep components small and focused** for better maintainability

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with linting or formatting:

1. Check that all dependencies are installed (`npm install`)
2. Ensure your IDE is configured correctly
3. Try resetting the ESLint and Prettier configuration
4. Consult with the team if issues persist
