# Brand and Campaign Management Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of brand and campaign management features in the SVYP application. Brands serve as top-level containers for campaigns, allowing for organized marketing and promotional activities. Each brand has a unique URL slug, logo, and name. Campaigns are associated with a specific brand and contain multiple products.

## Features Implemented

### Data Structure

- **Brand Type**: Created a `Brand` interface in `src/types/brand.ts` with the following properties:
  - `id`: Unique identifier
  - `name`: Brand name
  - `logoUrl`: URL to the brand's logo image
  - `slug`: URL-friendly unique identifier for the brand
  - `createdAt`: Timestamp for creation date
  - `updatedAt`: Timestamp for last update

- **Campaign Type**: Updated the `Campaign` interface in `src/types/campaign.ts` to include:
  - `id`: Unique identifier
  - `name`: Campaign name
  - `slug`: URL-friendly unique identifier for the campaign
  - `brandId`: Reference to the brand this campaign belongs to
  - `productIds`: Array of product IDs associated with the campaign
  - `createdAt`: Timestamp for creation date
  - `updatedAt`: Timestamp for last update

- **Product Type**: Updated the `Product` interface in `src/types/product.ts` to include:
  - `brandId`: Reference to the brand this product belongs to

### Firebase Integration

- **Brand Collection**: Added a new collection in Firebase Firestore to store brand data
- **CRUD Operations for Brands**: Implemented the following functions in `src/utils/firebase.ts`:
  - `fetchBrands()`: Retrieve all brands
  - `fetchBrandBySlug(slug)`: Find a brand by its URL slug
  - `fetchBrandById(id)`: Find a brand by its ID
  - `createBrand(brand)`: Create a new brand with slug uniqueness validation
  - `updateBrand(id, brand)`: Update an existing brand with slug uniqueness validation
  - `deleteBrand(id)`: Remove a brand

- **Updated Campaign Operations**:
  - Modified `fetchCampaignBySlug(slug, brandId)` to optionally filter by brandId
  - Updated campaign creation and editing to include brandId

### Admin Interface

- **Brand Management Page**: Created a new admin page at `src/app/admin/brands/page.tsx` for:
  - Viewing all brands in a list
  - Creating new brands with logo upload
  - Editing existing brands
  - Deleting brands

- **Updated Campaign Management**: Enhanced the campaign management page at `src/app/admin/campaigns/page.tsx` to:
  - Include brand selection when creating/editing campaigns
  - Display brand information in the campaign list
  - Update campaign URLs to include brand slug

- **Migration Utility**: Created a migration utility at `src/app/admin/migrate/page.tsx` to:
  - Create a default brand for existing campaigns
  - Associate existing campaigns with the default brand

### Frontend Display

- **Dynamic Routing**: Implemented nested dynamic routing at `src/app/[brandSlug]/[campaignSlug]/page.tsx` to:
  - Load brand and campaign data based on URL slugs
  - Verify that the campaign belongs to the specified brand
  - Display campaign-specific products using the SwipeContainer

- **Legacy Support**: Updated the existing `src/app/[slug]/page.tsx` route to:
  - Support legacy URLs during the transition period
  - Redirect to the new URL format when possible

- **Homepage**: Updated the homepage to display brands and their campaigns

### Component Updates

- **SafeImage**: Utilized the existing SafeImage component for displaying brand logos
- **SwipeContainer**: Updated to include brand context in analytics events

## Firebase Setup Requirements

To use the brand and campaign management features, the following Firebase setup is required:

1. **Firestore Collections**: 
   - "brands" collection in Firestore
   - "campaigns" collection with brandId field
   - "products" collection with brandId field

2. **Security Rules**: Update Firestore security rules to protect brand and campaign data:
   ```
   match /brands/{brandId} {
     allow read;
     allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid != null;
   }
   
   match /campaigns/{campaignId} {
     allow read;
     allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid != null;
   }
   ```

3. **Indexes**: Create a composite index for the campaigns collection:
   - Collection: campaigns
   - Fields to index: slug (Ascending), brandId (Ascending)

## URL Structure

The application now uses a hierarchical URL structure:

- Brand and Campaign Pages: `https://yourdomain.com/[brandSlug]/[campaignSlug]`
- Legacy Campaign URLs: `https://yourdomain.com/[campaignSlug]` (redirects to new format)

## Migration Process

To migrate existing campaigns to the new brand structure:

1. Access the migration utility at `/admin/migrate`
2. Create a default brand if one doesn't exist
3. Associate all unmigrated campaigns with the default brand
4. The system will automatically redirect old URLs to the new format

## Future Enhancements

- Brand-specific analytics dashboard
- Brand-level styling and theming
- Multiple brand administrators with different permissions
- Brand-specific product catalogs
- Brand performance comparison metrics

## Technical Considerations

- Brand slugs must be unique across the application
- Campaign slugs must be unique within a brand (but can be reused across different brands)
- Products can belong to multiple campaigns but are associated with a single brand
- Brand data is included in all analytics events for better tracking
- The image proxy solution is used for handling brand logos from external domains
