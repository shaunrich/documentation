# Vercel Blob Storage Setup

This project uses Vercel Blob Storage for image uploads in the admin panel. Follow these steps to set up Vercel Blob for your development and production environments.

## Prerequisites

- A Vercel account
- Your project deployed on Vercel (or ready to be deployed)

## Setup Steps

### 1. Get a Vercel Blob Token

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to the "Storage" tab in the project settings
4. Select "Blob" and click "Create" if you haven't already set it up
5. Once created, you can find your token by clicking on the Blob store and then viewing the "Tokens" section
6. Create a new token with read-write permissions if you don't already have one

### 2. Add Environment Variables

Add the following environment variable to your project:

```
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_vercel_blob_read_write_token
```

Add this to:
- Your local `.env.local` file for development
- Your Vercel project environment variables for production

### 3. Implementation Details

The implementation consists of:

1. **API Route**: An API endpoint at `/api/upload` that handles file uploads to Vercel Blob
2. **Admin UI**: A file upload component in the admin product form
3. **Image Storage**: Images are stored in Vercel Blob and their URLs are saved in Firebase

The admin panel now supports direct image uploads. When creating or editing a product:

1. Click the file input in the "Product Image" section
2. Select an image from your computer
3. The image will be automatically uploaded to Vercel Blob
4. Once uploaded, you'll see a preview of the image
5. The image URL will be stored in the product data when you save

### 4. Technical Implementation

The implementation uses:

- `@vercel/blob` package for interacting with Vercel Blob storage
- Next.js API routes for handling the upload process
- React state management for handling the upload UI

The image upload component replaces the previous URL input field, allowing for a more user-friendly experience while maintaining compatibility with the existing product data structure.

### 5. Image Optimization and Domain Handling

To handle images from various domains (including those not configured in Next.js), we've implemented:

1. **SafeImage Component**: A wrapper around Next.js Image component that:
   - Automatically detects if an image's domain is configured in Next.js
   - Uses Next.js Image directly for configured domains
   - Routes images from non-configured domains through a proxy API
   - Provides fallback handling for broken images

2. **Image Proxy API**: A server-side API route at `/api/proxy-image` that:
   - Fetches images from any external domain
   - Serves them through your own domain (which Next.js always accepts)
   - Includes proper caching headers for performance

This approach allows you to:
- Display images from any source without modifying Next.js configuration
- Benefit from Next.js image optimization for configured domains
- Handle errors gracefully with fallback images

#### Using the SafeImage Component

Replace the standard Next.js Image component with SafeImage:

```tsx
import SafeImage from '@/components/SafeImage';

// Use just like Next.js Image component
<SafeImage 
  src="https://example.com/image.jpg" 
  alt="Description" 
  width={300} 
  height={300}
  fallbackSrc="/placeholder-image.jpg" // Optional
/>
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter a 403 error during upload:

1. Check that your `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is correctly set and has the proper permissions
2. Verify that the token is for the correct Vercel project
3. Make sure your Vercel project has Blob storage enabled

If you see errors about unconfigured image domains:

1. Make sure you're using the `SafeImage` component instead of the standard Next.js `Image` component
2. Check the browser console for any errors related to the proxy API
3. Verify that the `/api/proxy-image` route is working correctly
