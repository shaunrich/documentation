# Admin User Roles Documentation

## Overview

The SVYP platform implements a role-based access control system for admin users. This document outlines the different roles, their permissions, and how to manage them.

## Role Types

The system supports two admin role types:

1. **Super Admin** (`super-admin`)
   - Full access to all admin functionalities
   - Can create, update, and delete other admin users
   - Can assign and modify roles for other users
   - Can perform all administrative actions

2. **Admin** (`admin`)
   - Limited administrative access
   - Can view all admin users
   - Can reset passwords for users
   - Can enable/disable users
   - Cannot create new admin users or modify roles

## Implementation Details

### Technical Architecture

The role-based access control is implemented using Firebase Authentication's custom claims:

- User roles are stored as custom claims in Firebase Authentication
- The `role` claim can be either `super-admin` or `admin`
- API routes verify the user's role before allowing access to protected operations
- The frontend UI conditionally renders admin actions based on the user's role

### Key Components

1. **User Interface**
   - The User Management page (`/admin/users`) displays all admin users
   - Role-specific actions are conditionally rendered based on the current user's role
   - Super admins see additional options like "Add User", "Update Role", and "Delete"

2. **API Routes**
   - `/api/users` - GET (list users), POST (create user)
   - `/api/users/[uid]` - DELETE (delete user), PATCH (update user)
   - All routes implement role verification middleware

3. **Firebase Admin SDK**
   - Custom utility functions in `firebase-admin.ts` handle role management
   - `getAllUsers()` - Retrieves all users with their roles
   - `createUser()` - Creates a new user with an optional role
   - `updateUserRole()` - Updates a user's role

## Setting Up Admin Users

### Initial Setup

To set up the first super-admin user:

1. Create a regular user through Firebase Authentication
2. Run the `setup-admin.ts` script to grant super-admin privileges:
   ```bash
   npm run setup-admin
   ```

### Creating Additional Admin Users

Once you have a super-admin user:

1. Log in as the super-admin
2. Navigate to the User Management page (`/admin/users`)
3. Click "Add User" and fill in the user details
4. Select the appropriate role (admin or super-admin)
5. Click "Add User" to create the new admin user

### Updating User Roles

To change a user's role:

1. Log in as a super-admin
2. Navigate to the User Management page
3. Find the user you want to update
4. Click "Update Role" in the Actions column
5. Select the new role in the modal dialog
6. Click "Update Role" to save the changes

## Security Considerations

- Only super-admins can create new admin users or modify roles
- All role-based permissions are enforced on both the client and server sides
- Session cookies are used for authentication and must be included in all API requests
- Custom claims are verified on the server for each protected operation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **401 Unauthorized Error**
   - Ensure the user has the correct role assigned
   - Verify that session cookies are being included in API requests (`credentials: 'include'`)
   - Check that the Firebase service account key is correctly configured

2. **Missing Admin Actions**
   - Confirm the user has the super-admin role
   - Try logging out and logging back in to refresh the token

3. **Cannot Create Users**
   - Verify Firebase Authentication settings allow email/password sign-up
   - Ensure the user making the request has super-admin privileges
