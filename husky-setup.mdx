# Husky Git Hooks Setup

This document explains the Git hooks setup using Husky in the SVYP project.

## Overview

We use [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) to manage Git hooks, which help enforce code quality standards before code is committed to the repository. This ensures that all code in the repository meets our quality standards.

## Pre-commit Hook

The pre-commit hook runs automatically when you attempt to commit changes. It performs the following checks:

- Lints JavaScript and TypeScript files with ESLint
- Formats code with Prettier
- Ensures consistent code style across the project

### What Files Are Checked?

The pre-commit hook only checks files that are staged for commit (using [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)), which makes the process faster and more focused.

- **JavaScript/TypeScript files** (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`):

  - ESLint for code quality
  - Prettier for consistent formatting

- **JSON and Markdown files** (`.json`, `.md`):
  - Prettier for consistent formatting

## Configuration Files

The setup includes the following configuration files:

- `.husky/pre-commit`: The pre-commit hook script
- `package.json`: Contains the lint-staged configuration
- `.prettierrc`: Prettier configuration for code formatting
- `.prettierignore`: Files excluded from Prettier formatting

## How to Use

### Normal Workflow

Simply stage your changes and commit as usual:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

The pre-commit hook will automatically run and check your code. If there are any issues:

1. The commit will be aborted
2. You'll see error messages explaining what needs to be fixed
3. Fix the issues and try committing again

### Bypassing Hooks (Emergency Only)

In rare emergency situations, you can bypass the hooks:

```bash
git commit --no-verify -m "Emergency fix"
```

**Note**: Use this sparingly and only in genuine emergencies. The team should be notified when hooks are bypassed.

## Troubleshooting

### Hook Not Running

If the hook isn't running, check that:

1. Husky is properly installed: `npm list husky`
2. The hook file is executable: `ls -la .husky/pre-commit`
3. Git hooks are enabled: `git config core.hooksPath`

### ESLint or Prettier Errors

If you're getting errors:

1. Run ESLint manually to see detailed errors: `npx eslint src/path/to/file.ts`
2. Run Prettier manually: `npx prettier --write src/path/to/file.ts`
3. Consider using editor extensions for ESLint and Prettier to catch issues while coding

## Adding New Hooks

To add a new Git hook:

1. Create a new file in the `.husky` directory (e.g., `.husky/pre-push`)
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x .husky/pre-push`
3. Add your commands to the file

## Maintenance

The Husky setup is maintained through:

- `package.json` dependencies
- The `.husky` directory
- Configuration files (`.prettierrc`, etc.)

When updating dependencies, ensure Husky and lint-staged are kept up to date.
