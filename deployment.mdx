# SVYP Project Deployment Documentation

This document outlines the deployment process for the SVYP project, including both manual and automated deployment methods.

## Environment Overview

The SVYP project uses the following environments:

1. **Local Development**: Running on developer machines for feature development and testing
2. **Staging**: Deployed from the `develop` branch for QA and testing
3. **Production**: Deployed from the `main` branch for end users

All environments are hosted on Vercel, which provides preview deployments, continuous integration, and production hosting.

## Automated Deployments

The SVYP project uses GitHub Actions to automate deployments to both staging and production environments.

### Staging Deployment

**Trigger**: Automatic deployment occurs when code is pushed to the `develop` branch.

**Workflow File**: `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml`

**Process**:

1. GitHub Actions checks out the code
2. Sets up Node.js 18 and installs dependencies
3. Configures Vercel project settings
4. Builds and deploys to Vercel preview environment
5. Adds a comment to the commit with the deployment URL

**Viewing Deployments**:

- Check the GitHub Actions tab in the repository to see deployment status
- Look for commit comments with deployment URLs
- Access the Vercel dashboard to see all preview deployments

### Production Deployment

**Trigger**: Automatic deployment occurs when code is pushed to the `main` branch.

**Workflow File**: `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml`

**Process**:

1. GitHub Actions checks out the code
2. Sets up Node.js 18 and installs dependencies
3. Configures Vercel project settings
4. Builds and deploys to Vercel production environment
5. Adds a comment to the commit with the deployment URL

**Production URL**: [https://svyp.vercel.app](https://svyp.vercel.app) (replace with actual production URL)

## Manual Deployments

In case you need to deploy manually, follow these steps:

1. **Install Vercel CLI** (if not already installed):

   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Link your local project** (first-time only):

   ```bash
   vercel link
   ```

3. **Deploy to preview/staging**:

   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

4. **Deploy to production**:
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required for deployment:

| Variable                                   | Description                                | Required In      |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`             | Firebase API key                           | All environments |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`         | Firebase auth domain                       | All environments |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`          | Firebase project ID                        | All environments |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`      | Firebase storage bucket                    | All environments |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` | Firebase messaging sender ID               | All environments |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID`              | Firebase app ID                            | All environments |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MIXPANEL_TOKEN`               | Mixpanel analytics token                   | All environments |
| `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`                    | Firebase admin client email                | Production only  |
| `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`                     | Firebase admin private key                 | Production only  |
| `POSTMARK_API_TOKEN`                       | Postmark API token for email delivery      | Production only  |
| `POSTMARK_FROM_EMAIL`                      | Verified sender email address for Postmark | Production only  |

These variables should be configured in the Vercel project settings and as GitHub secrets for automated deployments.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Deployment Fails with Authentication Error**:

   - Verify that the `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, and `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` secrets are correctly set in GitHub
   - Ensure the Vercel token has the necessary permissions

2. **Build Fails Due to Missing Environment Variables**:

   - Check that all required environment variables are set in Vercel project settings
   - For local builds, ensure you have a `.env.local` file with the necessary variables

3. **Vercel CLI Command Not Found**:
   - Reinstall the Vercel CLI: `npm install -g vercel`

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues with deployments:

1. Check the GitHub Actions logs for detailed error messages
2. Review the Vercel deployment logs in the Vercel dashboard
3. Contact the project maintainer or DevOps team for assistance
