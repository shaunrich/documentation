# Campaign Management Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of campaign management features in the SVYP application. Campaigns serve as containers for products, allowing for targeted marketing and promotional activities. Each campaign has a unique URL (slug) and can contain multiple products.

## Features Implemented

### Data Structure

- **Campaign Type**: Created a `Campaign` interface in `src/types/campaign.ts` with the following properties:
  - `id`: Unique identifier
  - `name`: Campaign name
  - `slug`: URL-friendly unique identifier for the campaign
  - `productIds`: Array of product IDs associated with the campaign
  - `createdAt`: Timestamp for creation date
  - `updatedAt`: Timestamp for last update

### Firebase Integration

- **Campaign Collection**: Added a new collection in Firebase Firestore to store campaign data
- **CRUD Operations**: Implemented the following functions in `src/utils/firebase.ts`:
  - `fetchCampaigns()`: Retrieve all campaigns
  - `fetchCampaignBySlug(slug)`: Find a campaign by its URL slug
  - `fetchCampaignById(id)`: Find a campaign by its ID
  - `fetchProductsForCampaign(campaignId)`: Get all products associated with a campaign
  - `createCampaign(campaign)`: Create a new campaign with slug uniqueness validation
  - `updateCampaign(id, campaign)`: Update an existing campaign with slug uniqueness validation
  - `deleteCampaign(id)`: Remove a campaign

### Admin Interface

- **Campaign Management Page**: Created a new admin page at `src/app/admin/campaigns/page.tsx` for:
  - Viewing all campaigns in a list
  - Creating new campaigns with product selection
  - Editing existing campaigns
  - Deleting campaigns
- **Admin Navigation**: Updated the main admin dashboard to include a link to the campaign management page

### Frontend Display

- **Dynamic Campaign Routes**: Implemented dynamic routing at `src/app/[slug]/page.tsx` to:
  - Load campaign data based on the URL slug
  - Display campaign-specific products using the SwipeContainer
  - Show appropriate loading and error states

### Component Updates

- **SwipeContainer**: Updated to accept and utilize campaign information:
  - Added campaign-related props (campaignId, campaignName, campaignSlug)
  - Passed campaign context to child components
- **ProductCard**: Enhanced to include campaign data in analytics events

### Analytics Integration

- **Campaign Tracking**: Updated analytics utility to include campaign information in all events:
  - Added campaign fields (id, name, slug) to all product-related events
  - Created a new `trackCampaignView` event for tracking campaign page visits

## Firebase Setup Requirements

To use the campaign management features, the following Firebase setup is required:

1. **Firestore Collection**: Create a "campaigns" collection in Firestore
2. **Security Rules**: Update Firestore security rules to protect campaign data:
   ```
   match /campaigns/{campaignId} {
     allow read;
     allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid != null;
   }
   ```
3. **Indexes**: You may need to create an index on the `slug` field in the campaigns collection for efficient queries

## Usage Flow

1. **Admin Creates Campaign**:
   - Admin navigates to the campaign management page
   - Creates a new campaign with a unique slug
   - Selects products to include in the campaign

2. **Campaign URL Generation**:
   - A unique URL is generated based on the campaign slug (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/campaign-slug`)

3. **User Interaction**:
   - Users visit the campaign URL
   - They see only the products associated with that campaign
   - All user interactions (views, likes, dislikes) are tracked with campaign context

## Future Enhancements

- Campaign analytics dashboard
- Campaign scheduling (start/end dates)
- Campaign-specific styling and branding
- A/B testing capabilities
- Campaign performance metrics

## Technical Considerations

- Campaign slugs must be unique across the application
- Products can belong to multiple campaigns
- Campaign data is included in all analytics events for better tracking
- The dynamic routing system allows for SEO-friendly campaign URLs
